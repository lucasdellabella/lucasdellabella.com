Hey! I'm Lucas - curious, excitable, and someone who just loves learning new things, and hacking on new shit.

I like to play with code, compose tunes, and record video. I'm pretty much always game for coffee. I love being of use to others.

I'm in my late 20s and still figuring out who I am. Huh 🤔 Guess it never changes.

Recently, [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/), [Peter Levels](https://levels.io/blog/), and [The Mom Test](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52283963-the-mom-test) inspired me to just... make. I hadn't realized that you _could_ build a small tech business. I assumed that everything had to be go-big-or-go-home, winner-take-all endeavors. Realizing that we can build software for niche markets that VCs won't touch has opened my eyes and gotten me hyped to build again 😤

I'm also pretty forgetful, and often lose projects I'm working on because of my laptop getting blown up! Haha! Oops! Here's one to all my attentionally challenged friends out there! 🍻
